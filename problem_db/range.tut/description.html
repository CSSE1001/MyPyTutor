<h3>Using Range</h3>
<p>
    The built-in function <tt>range</tt> returns sequences of numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>sum_range(start, end)</tt> which uses <tt>range</tt> to return the sum of the numbers from start up to, but not including, end.
    (Including start but excluding end is the default behaviour of <tt>range</tt>.)
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>sum_evens(start, end)</tt> which does the same thing, but which only includes even numbers.
    You should also use <tt>range</tt>.
