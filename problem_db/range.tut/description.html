<h3>Using Range</h3>

    The built-in function <tt>range</tt> returns an iterable sequence of numbers.
<p>
    Write a function <tt>sum_range(start, end)</tt> which uses <tt>range</tt> to return the sum of the numbers from <tt>start</tt> up to, but not including, <tt>end</tt>.
    (Including <tt>start</tt> but excluding <tt>end</tt> is the default behaviour of <tt>range</tt>.)
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>sum_evens(start, end)</tt> which does the same thing, but which only includes even numbers.
    You should also use <tt>range</tt>.
