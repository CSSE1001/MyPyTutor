<h3>Summing Elements of a List</h3>
<p>
    Python comes with a built-in function <tt>sum</tt> that adds together all the elements of a list of numbers.
    For this problem you will write your own version.
</p>
<p>
    Write a function definition of <tt>sum_elems</tt> using a for loop that takes a list of numbers, and returns the sum of all the elements of the list.
    Your solution must not use the built-in function <tt>sum</tt>.
