<h3>Input and Output</h3>
Variables are used to store data for later use in a program.
For example, the statement
<br>
<tt>word = 'cats'</tt>
<br>
assigns the string <tt>'cats'</tt> to the variable <tt>word</tt>.
<p>
We can then use the value stored in the variable in an expression.
For example,
<br>
<tt>sentence = 'I like ' + word + '!'</tt>
<br>
will assign the string <tt>'I like cats!'</tt> to the variable <tt>sentence</tt>.

<p>
When creating a variable, we can use any name we like, but it's better to choose a
name which makes clear the meaning of the value in the variable.

<p>
The first two lines of the provided code will ask the user to input two words,
and will store them in variables <tt>word1</tt> and <tt>word2</tt>.

Below that is a call to the <tt>print</tt> function which outputs the value in
a variable <tt>combined</tt>.

Write an assignment statement in the space between that adds the strings
<tt>word1</tt> and <tt>word2</tt>, and stores the result in the variable
<tt>combined</tt>.
<p>
For example, if the words <tt>reap</tt> and <tt>pear</tt> are input, the output
should be <tt>reappear</tt>.
