<h3>Processing Strings Using a For Loop</h3>
    For loops provide another mechanism (like while loops) for carrying out repeated computations.
    The main difference is that a for loop iterates through the elements of an iterable object.
<p>
    A for statement has the form:
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    for var in iterable:
        body_code
    </pre>
<p>
    where <tt>var</tt> is a variable, <tt>iterable</tt> is an iterable object and <tt>body_code</tt> is a sequence of statements.
</p>
<p>
    In turn, each element of <tt>iterable</tt> is assigned to <tt>var</tt> and, in that context, <tt>body_code</tt> is evaluated.
</p>

<p>
Typically, <tt>var</tt> appears in <tt>body_code</tt>
</p>
<p>
    For example, the following prints the elements in a string one line at a time.
    <br>
    <pre>
    for c in "hello world":
        print(c)
    </pre>
</p>

<p>
    Write a function definition of <tt>occurrences(text1, text2)</tt> that takes two string arguments.
    The function returns the number of times a character from the first argument occurs in the second argument.
