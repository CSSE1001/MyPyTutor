<h3>Constructing a List from Another List</h3>
One typical kind of list processing is to construct a list from information
in another list. This is typically done by iterating over the input list using
a for loop and building up the result in another list.
<p>
Write a function definition of <tt>all_gt</tt>
that takes a list of numbers, say <tt>nums</tt>, and a number, say <tt>n</tt> and returns the list of numbers from <tt>nums</tt> that are greater than
<tt>n</tt>. The order of elements should be preserved.

<p>For example:
<br><tt>all_gt([1,2,3,4], 2) => [3,4]</tt>
<br><tt>all_gt([1,2,3,4], 4) => []</tt>
