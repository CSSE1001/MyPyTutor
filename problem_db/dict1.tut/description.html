<h3>Accessing a Dictionary</h3>
Dictionaries are iterable objects that store associations between 'keys' and values.
<p>
    Here is a dictionary that accociates weekday names with a 'day number'.
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    {'Sunday':0, 'Monday':1, 'Tuesday':2, 'Wednesday':3,
     'Thursday':4, 'Friday':5, 'Saturday':6}
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Values can be retrieved from dictionaries using square brackets, in the same way that elements of a string or a list can be selected.
    The difference here is that the key goes within the square brackets.
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>get_value(dictionary, key)</tt> which returns the value for the given key in the given dictionary.
