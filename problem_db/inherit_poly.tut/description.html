<h3>Inheritance - Polymorphism</h3>
<p>
    One advantage of using subclasses is the ability to use polymorphism.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind polymorphism is that several different types of objects can have the same methods, and be treated in the same way.
</p>
<p>
    For example, have a look at the code we've included for this problem.
    We've defined <tt>Shape</tt> as an abstract base class.
    It doesn't provide any functionality by itself, but it does supply an interface (in the form of <tt>.area()</tt> and <tt>.vertices()</tt> methods) which are meaningful for any type of 2D Shape.
</p>
<p>
    The <tt>total_area</tt> function makes use of this to calculate the area of any kind of <tt>Shape</tt>.
    We've provided an example of this with two <tt>Square</tt> instances.
</p>
<p>
    We want you to write <tt>RightAngledTriangle</tt> and <tt>Rectangle</tt> classes which implement this interface.
</p>
<p>
    The constructor for <tt>RightAngledTriangle</tt> accepts one argument, <tt>vertices</tt>, being a list of the points of the triangle relative to its origin.
    The first vertex will be at the right angle.
</p>
<p>
    The constructor for <tt>Rectangle</tt> accepts <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>.
