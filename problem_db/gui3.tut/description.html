<h3>GUI Layout Example III</h3>
<p>
    We're continuing the theme of laying out buttons in a frame.
    In this question, you'll need to add fixed spacing between your widgets.
</p>
<p>
    You need to write a function <tt>create_layout</tt> that takes a frame as its only argument and adds four buttons in the layout shown below.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="layout3.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
    The callback (command) for both buttons should be the <tt>pressed</tt> function.
</p>
<p>
    This layout must be achieved using an additional <tt>Frame</tt>.
    You will probably want to look at the <tt>fill</tt> and <tt>expand</tt> keyword arguments to <tt>pack</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    As in the previous questions, there is no need to create a tk app (the root window and frame will be initialised for you).
</p>
<p>
    When you check your code a window should pop up showing your layout.
    Close the popup window before trying again or moving to a new problem.
