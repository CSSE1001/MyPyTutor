<h3>GUI Layout Example II</h3>
<p>
    We're continuing the theme of laying out buttons in a frame.
    In this question, you'll need to add fixed spacing between your widgets.
</p>
<p>
    You need to write a function <tt>create_layout</tt> that takes a frame as its only argument and adds two buttons on top of each other in the frame.
    The first (top) button should have the label <tt>"Button1"</tt>, and the other should have the label <tt>"Button2"</tt>.
    The callback (command) for both buttons should be the <tt>pressed</tt> function.
</p>
<p>
    The first button should have 20 pixels of space above and below it.
    The second button should have 20 pixels of internal space on its left and right.
</p>
<p>
    Both buttons should appear on the far left of the frame.
</p>
<p>
    As in the previous question, there is no need to create a tk app (the root window and frame will be initialised for you).
</p>
<p>
    The frame should appear as depicted below.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="layout2.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
    When you check your code a window should pop up showing your layout.
    Close the popup window before trying again or moving to a new problem.
