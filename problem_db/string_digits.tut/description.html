<h3>Finding Digits in Strings</h3>
    This task is to implement a function <tt>get_digits(str1)</tt> that takes a string as input, and returns the string of digits in <tt>str1</tt> in the order they appear in <tt>str1</tt>.

<p>
    You should use a for loop to iterate over the string.
</p>
<p>
    You will find a built-in string method very useful.
    Remember that you can get a list of all string method with <tt>dir(str)</tt>, and help on a specific method with, eg, <tt>help(str.split)</tt>.
</p>
