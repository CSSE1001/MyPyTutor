<h3>Finding the Mean</h3>
    The mean (or average) of a non-empty list of <tt>n</tt> numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by <tt>n</tt>.
    For example, the mean of 2, 7, 3, 9, and 13 is (2+7+3+9+13)/5, or 6.8.
    Write a function <tt>mean</tt> that takes as input a non-empty list of numbers (of any length > 0) and returns the mean.
