<h3>Using Inheritance</h3>

<p>
    Consider the following (base) class.
</p>
<pre>
class Employee(object):
   def __init__(self, name, salary):
       self._name = name
       self._salary = salary

   def my_name(self):
       return self._name

   def wage(self):
       return self._salary/26   # fortnight pay
</pre>
<p>
    Define a new subclass of <tt>Employee</tt> called <tt>Worker</tt>.
    A worker has a manager, who is another employee; their manager is given as an argument to the constructor.
</p>
<p>
    You should define a method <tt>get_manager</tt> that returns the worker's manager.
</p>
<pre>
    boss = Employee('Mr. Burns', 1000000)
    worker = Worker('Waylon Smithers', 2500, boss)
</pre>

<p>
    Define another subclass of <tt>Employee</tt> called <tt>Executive</tt>.
    An executive has a yearly bonus in addition to a wage.
</p>
<p>
    Override the <tt>Employee.wage</tt> method in order to take the bonus into account.
    You must call <tt>Employee.wage</tt> from <tt>Executive.wage</tt> (using <tt>super</tt>).
    Remember that the existing <tt>wage</tt> method calculates a fortnightly pay, but the bonus is annual.
</p>
<pre>
    executive = Executive('Joseph Bloggs', 25000, 10000)
</pre>
