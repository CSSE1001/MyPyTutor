<h3>Inheritance - Method Calls</h3>
<p>
    Consider the following class definitions.
</p>
<pre>
class C1():
    def f(self):
        return 2*self.g()

    def g(self):
        return 2

class C2(C1):
    def f(self):
        return 3*self.g()


class C3(C1):
    def g(self):
        return 5

class C4(C3):
    def f(self):
        return 7*self.g()

obj1 = C1()
obj2 = C2()
obj3 = C3()
obj4 = C4()
</pre>

<p>
    For this problem you are to consider which methods are called when the <tt>f</tt> method is called.
    Because the classes form part of an inheritance hierarchy, working out what happens will not always be straightforward.
</p>
<p>
    For each of <tt>obj1</tt>, <tt>obj2</tt>, <tt>obj3</tt>, and <tt>obj4</tt>, print out the methods which will be called following a call to <tt>objn.f()</tt>.
    You should print a single line in the format: <tt>objn: call1, call2, call3</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    So for example, when <tt>obj1.f()</tt> is called, you should print:
</p>
<pre>
    <tt>obj1: C1.f, C1.g</tt>
</pre>
<p>
    We've already done this for you to give you an example.
</p>
<p>
    Note: You don't need to actually call the methods, you just need to write a print statement, as for <tt>obj1.f()</tt> above.
    All you need are the four print statements.
</p>
