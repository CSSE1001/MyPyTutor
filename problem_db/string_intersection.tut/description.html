<h3>Intersecting Strings</h3>

    Write a function <tt>intersection(str1, str2)</tt> which returns the intersection of <tt>str1</tt> and <tt>str2</tt>.
    However, each letter should be represented at most once in the output.

<p>
    The letters should be in the order they appear in the first string.
    You should use a for loop to iterate over the first string.
