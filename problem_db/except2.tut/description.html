<h3>Raising an Exception</h3>

<p>
    In the previous problem, you used a try/except statement to catch an exception.
    This problem deals with the opposite situation: raising an exception in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    One common situation in which you will want to raise an exception is where you need to indicate that some precondition that your code relies upon has not been met.
    (You may also see the <tt>assert</tt> statement used for this purpose, but we won't cover that here.)
</p>

<p>
    Write a function <tt>validate_input(string)</tt> which takes a command string in the format <tt>'command arg1 arg2'</tt> and returns the pair <tt>('command', [arg1, arg2])</tt>, where <tt>arg1</tt> and <tt>arg2</tt> have been converted to floats.
    If the command is not one of <tt>'add'</tt>, <tt>'sub'</tt>, <tt>'mul'</tt>, or <tt>'div'</tt>, it must raise <tt>InvalidCommand</tt>.
    If the arguments cannot be converted to <tt>floats</tt>, it must raise <tt>InvalidCommand</tt>.
