<h3>Introduction: Hello, World!</h3>

This is a simple example aimed at demonstrating the MyPyTutor system.
<p>
    For this problem you need to write a program which outputs <tt>"Hellow, World!"</tt>.
    You can achieve this using the built-in <tt>print</tt> function.
</p>
<p>
    If you get stuck using MyPyTutor, you can get an overview of how to use the program and how to fix common errors by selecting Help from the Online menu.
    We provide only a very brief overview in this question.
</p>
<p>
    This window contains this text and the text boxes below contain all output from running tests on your code.
</p>
<p>
    The other window is almost identical to the window you use in IDLE for entering your code.
    You do the same here - entering your solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>
    When you have entered an answer choose the 'Check' item from the 'Check' menu or press the F5 key.
    This will cause MyPyTutor to check your solution.
</p>
<p>
    If you get it right, all of the tests in this window will go green, and you should get no red output in the bottom (Analysis) box.
    If your output is incorrect, select the test in red to see what went wrong.
    Quite often, you'll be stuck in the same place as other students.
    In such cases, we try to offer hints in the Analysis box.
</p>
<p>
    Occasionally, we require you to complete problems in a particular way (for example, by using a <tt>for</tt> loop).
    This will be enforced through hints in the Analysis box.
    Even if you have the right answer, you may need to change your code a little in order to show us that you understand the concept we're examining.

    If you have any feedback on MyPyTutor, we'd love to hear it.
    You can provide General or Problem-specific feedback from the Feedback menu.
