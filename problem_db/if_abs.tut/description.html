<h3>If Statements</h3>
<p>
    If statements allow you to run different code based on conditions that you set.
    The simplest if statement looks something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    if condition:
        code
        [code...]
</pre>
<p>
    If <tt>condition</tt> evaluates to <tt>True</tt>, <tt>code</tt> (which could be many lines of statements) will be run.
</p>
<p>
    If <tt>condition</tt> evaluates to <tt>False</tt>, then Python will skip to the next line of code <it>after</it> the if statement.
</p>
<p>
    For example, this code will print <tt>'Monty'</tt>, but not <tt>'Python'</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
    x = 2
    y = 0

    if x > 1:
        print('Monty')

    if y > 1:
        print('Python')
</pre>
<p>
    We want you to prompt the user to enter an integer, and then print the absolute value of that integer.
</p>
<p>
    You'll need to convert the string you get from <tt>input</tt> into an integer, as in the previous question.
    If the user enters a negative number, you need to make it positive (that's what the if statement is for!)
