<h3>Tuple Assignment</h3>
    The components of a tuple can be assigned to individual variables.
<p>
    So, for example, if we create a point in 3D space:
</p>
<pre>
    pt = (1, 2, 3)
</pre>
<p>
    then we can later assign its components to individual variables:
</p>
<pre>
    x, y, z = pt
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    The <tt>str.partition</tt> method can be used to separate the components of a string:
</p>
<pre>
    >>> help(str.partition)
    Help on method_descriptor:

    partition(...)
        S.partition(sep) -> (head, sep, tail)

        Search for the separator sep in S, and return the part before it,
        the separator itself, and the part after it.  If the separator is not
        found, return S and two empty strings.
</pre>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>get_names()</tt> which prompts the user to enter their name, and then returns a tuple containing their first and last names.
    You must use <tt>str.partition</tt> to separate the user's first and last names.
    You must 'unpack' the result of <tt>str.partition</tt> into separate variables.
    You may assume that the user only enters two names.
</p>
