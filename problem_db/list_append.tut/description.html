<h3>Transforming a List</h3>
    One typical kind of list processing is to transform the elements of a list, producing a copy of the list but with the elements transformed.
<p>
    Write a function definition of <tt>add_sizes</tt> using a for loop that takes a list of strings, say <tt>strings</tt>, and returns a list of pairs consisting of the elements of <tt>strings</tt> together with their lengths.
