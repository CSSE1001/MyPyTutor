<h3>Accessing a Dictionary Using Get</h3>
Using square brackets to look up information in a dictionary using a key is fine as long as the key is in the dictionary. If it is not then an exception occurs.
<p>
    The dictionary method <tt>get</tt> avoids this problem by returning a value instead of raising an exception. The first argument of <tt>get</tt> is the dictionary
    key for the value desired. If this key does not exist within the dictionary, <tt>get</tt> returns <tt>None</tt> or, if a second argument to <tt>get</tt> is provided,
    this is returned instead. If the key does exist within the dictionary, <tt>get</tt> behaves just as though the dictionary were indexed with square brackets.
<p>
    Here is a dictionary that associates weekday names with a 'day number'.<p>
    <pre>
    {'Sunday':0, 'Monday':1, 'Tuesday':2, 'Wednesday':3,
        'Thursday':4, 'Friday':5, 'Saturday':6}
    </pre>
<p>
Write a function <tt>get_value(dictionary, key)</tt> which returns the value for the given key in the given dictionary, using the <tt>get</tt> method. If the key is
    not valid, your function should return <tt>-1</tt>.
<p>For example, if <tt>day</tt> is <tt>'Wednesday'</tt> then <tt>day_num</tt>
should be  <tt>3</tt> and if <tt>day</tt> is <tt>'Talk Like a Pirate Day'</tt> then <tt>day_num</tt> should be  <tt>-1</tt>.
