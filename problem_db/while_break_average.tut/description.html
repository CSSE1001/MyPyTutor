<h3>While Using Break</h3>

Sometimes it is convenient to be able to break out of a while loop from within
the body of the while loop using the <tt>break</tt> command. 
This is often the case when it is more sensible to 
test a condition in the body that is different from the while loop condition.
<p>
A typical case is
</p>
<p>
<pre>
while condition1:
    some_code
    if condition2:
       break
    more_code
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If the execution gets to the <tt>if</tt> statement and <tt>condition2</tt> is 
true then the while loop is exited.

</p>
<p>
This problem is a variant of the while loop problem but instead of specifying
the number of numbers to be entered, the loop is terminated when the user enters
the empty string (blank line).
</p>
<p>
Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for
numbers and adds the numbers to a running total. When a blank line is entered, 
the program should print the average of all the numbers entered. 
You need to use a break statement to exit the while loop.
