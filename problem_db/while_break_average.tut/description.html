<h3>While Using Break</h3>

Sometimes it is convenient to be able to break out of a while loop from within
the body of the while loop using the <tt>break</tt> command. 
This is often the case when it is more sensible to 
test a condition in the body that is different from the while loop condition.
<p>
A typical case is
</p>
<p>
<pre>
while condition1:
    some_code
    if condition2:
       break
    more_code
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If the execution gets to the <tt>if</tt> statement and <tt>condition2</tt> is 
true then the while loop is exited.

</p>
<p>
This problem is a variant of the while loop problem but instead of specifying
the number of numbers to be entered, the loop is terminated when the user enters
the empty string (blank line).
</p>
<p>
Write a program that uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for
numbers and adds the numbers to a running total. When a blank line is entered, 
the program should print the average of all the numbers entered. 
You need to use a break statement to exit the while loop.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This approach of exiting from a loop in the middle is generally poor
programming practice. It is introduced because you will encounter it in code that you
read from other sources. There are times when it is an appropriate solution, but that
decision is based on design experience determining that it is a simpler solution than
providing the logic to continue through half of the loop. If the body of the loop has
several if conditions or several lines of code this type of break can make the logic
difficult to follow and should be avoided. For assignments in this and following courses
you should avoid breaking from the middle of a loop unless you are confident it is the
simplest solution.
