<h3>Defining a Class</h3>
Define the class <tt>Rectangle</tt>. It's constructor takes a pair of numbers representing the top-left corner, and two other numbers representing the width and height. It has the following methods:
<ul>
    <li><tt>get_bottom_right()</tt> - return the bottom right corner as a pair of numbers.</li>
    <li> <tt>move(p)</tt> - move the rectangle so that p becomes the top-left corner (leaving the width and height unchanged).</li>
    <li> <tt>resize(width, height)</tt> - set the width and height of the rectangle to the supplied arguments (leaving the top-left corner unchanged).</li>
    <li> <tt>__str__()</tt> - return the string representation of the rectangle as a pair of pairs - i.e. the top left and bottom right corners.</li>
</ul>

Note: Unlike the co-ordinate system you may have encountered before, y, in this question, increases as you move vertically downwards.

Each example below follows on from the previous one.

Be careful to get the spacing right for str - i.e. comma followed by space.
<pre>
>>> r = Rectangle((2,3), 5, 7)
>>> str(r)
'((2, 3), (7, 10))'
>>> r.move((5,6))
>>> str(r)
'((5, 6), (10, 13))'
>>> r.resize(2,3)
>>> str(r)
'((5,6), (7, 9))'
>>> r.get_bottom_right()
(7, 9)
</pre>
