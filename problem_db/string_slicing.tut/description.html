<h3>Slicing Strings</h3>
<p>
    Any iterable object can be sliced.
    Slicing is used to extract a sub-collection of elements.
    For example, slicing can be used to get elements for a range of indicies.
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>slice_from(string, start, end)</tt> which returns the characters in <tt>string</tt> from index <tt>start</tt> up to, but not including, index <tt>end</tt>.
    (Note that this characteristic of including the character at the start index, but not including the one at the end index, is the default slicing behaviour.)
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>reverse_string(string)</tt> which returns the characters in <tt>string</tt> in reverse order.
    You must use a single slice statement to achieve this.
