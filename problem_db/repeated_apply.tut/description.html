<h3>Repeated Function Application</h3>

Write a recursive function <tt>repeatedlyApply</tt> that takes as arguments a function
<tt>f</tt> of one argument and a positive integer <tt>n</tt>. The result of <tt>repeatedlyApply</tt> is a function of one argument that applies <tt>f</tt> to that argument <tt>n</tt> times.
<p>
So, for example, we would have
<p>
<pre>
repeatedlyApply(lambda x: x+1,10)(100) ==> 110
</pre>            
<p>
You may assume that the following function has been defined. You don't have to use it, but it can contribute to a pretty solution.
<p>
<pre>
def compose(f,g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))
</pre>
