<h3>Accessing String Elements</h3>
First note that all iterable objects (such as strings) "start counting
from index 0". This means that the first element of a string is at index 0.
<p>
    Prompt for a single string (using <tt>input</tt>), and print the first, second, and last characters of this string (on separate lines).
    You may assume that the string has enough characters.
<p>
    For example, if the input string is <tt>"Spam"</tt>, then you should print <tt>"S"</tt>, <tt>"p"</tt>, and <tt>"m"</tt>.
