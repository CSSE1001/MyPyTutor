<h3>GUI Layout Example I</h3>
<p>
    One important aspect of GUI design is the layout of widgets in an application.
</p>
<p>
    In this problem you will lay out two buttons in a frame.
    Note that, although this problem uses buttons, the same layout ideas apply to any widget (including other frames).
</p>
<p>
    You need to write a function <tt>create_layout</tt> that takes a frame as its only argument and adds two buttons at the left of the frame.
    The first (leftmost) button should have the label <tt>"Button1"</tt>, and the other should have the label <tt>"Button2"</tt>.
    The callback (command) for both buttons should be the <tt>pressed</tt> function.
</p>
<p>
    There is no need to create a tk app (the root window and frame will be initialised for you).
</p>
<p>
    You must use <tt>pack</tt> for layout and <b>not</b> <tt>grid</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    The frame should appear as depicted below.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="layout1.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
    When you check your code a window should pop up showing your layout.
    Close the popup window before trying again or moving to a new problem.
