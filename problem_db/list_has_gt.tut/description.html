<h3>Processing Lists Using a For Loop</h3>
<p>
    Lists are iterable objects and so for loops are typically used to process them.
</p>
<p>
    Write a function <tt>has_gt</tt> that takes a list of numbers and a number and returns <tt>True</tt> if the first argument contains a number greater than the second argument and <tt>False</tt> otherwise.
