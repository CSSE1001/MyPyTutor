<h3>Using Functions</h3>
This problem is about using functions that return values.
<p>
The supplied functions <tt>increment</tt> and <tt>double</tt> respectively
return the increment (by one) and the double of its argument, for example
<tt>increment(3)</tt> evaluates to <tt>4</tt> and <tt>double(5)</tt> evaluates to <tt>10</tt>.
<br>
Further assume
the variable <tt>n</tt> contains an integer value (remember that this means MyPyTutor will choose a value for <tt>n</tt>).
<p>
Write a single assignment statement using both of these functions that assigns <tt>2*(n+1)</tt> to
the variable <tt>m</tt>.
