<h3>Using Functions</h3>
<p>
    You can think of a function as a block of code which takes in zero or more values (arguments) and returns a result.
    For example, the <tt>double</tt> function which we provided looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
    def double(x):
        return x*2
</pre>
<p>
    This function has one argument, <tt>x</tt>, and a single <tt>return</tt> statement.
</p>
<p>
    To use this function, we provide a value for its argument.
    We can store its return value in a variable, eg:
</p>
<pre>
    four = double(2)
</pre>
<p>
    Prompt the user to enter a number, say <tt>n</tt>.
    Convert this number to an integer, and print <tt>2*(n + 1)</tt>
</p>
<p>
    You must use <tt>double</tt> and <tt>increment</tt> rather than just writing out the math yourself.
    You will need to convert the input into an integer, as before.
