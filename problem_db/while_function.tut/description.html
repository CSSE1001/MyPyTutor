<h3>Writing a Function Using While</h3>


<p>
Write a function <tt>div_3_5(start, end)</tt> that computes the number of integers from  <tt>start</tt>
up to, but not including <tt>end</tt> that are divisible by 3 or 5 using
a while loop.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
<br>
<tt>div_3_5(7, 27)</tt> evaluates to
9  ( numbers divisible by 3 or 5 in that range: 9,10,12,15,18,20,21,24,25)
<br>
