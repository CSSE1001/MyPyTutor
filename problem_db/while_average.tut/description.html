<h3>While Statements</h3>
While statements provide a mechanism that allows repeated 
computations to be performed. The while statement has the form:
<br>
<pre>
while condition:
    body_code
</pre>
<br>
where <tt>condition</tt> is a  boolean valued 
expressions and <tt>body_code</tt> 
is a 
sequences of statements.
<p>
<tt>body_code</tt> is repeatedly evaluated until <tt>condition</tt> becomes 
false and in which case computation continues with the statement following 
the while statement.
</p>
When writing a while loop there are a few things that you need to consider.
<ul>
<li>Typically, you will need to initialize one or more variables before the 
while statement. </li>
<li>The condition (test) of the while statement will usually become false 
eventually (otherwise the loop won't terminate).
</li>
<li>The body code typically changes one or more variables in such a way that 
the condition will become false.</li>
</ul> 
For example, the following code, when executed, will output a countdown.
The variable <tt>count</tt> is first initialized, the condition tests if
<tt>count</tt> has reached 0, and in the body of the loop <tt>count</tt> is decremented (and will eventually become 0).
<br>
<pre>
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print count
    count = count - 1
print "Thunderbirds are Go"
</pre>
<br>
Write a program that first prompts the user to enter the number of numbers to 
be entered and then uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for
those numbers and adds the numbers to a running total. When the correct
number of numbers have been entered, the program should print the average.

<p>You can assume the number of numbers entered is an integer greater than zero and that each subsequent number is a float.
