MyPyTutor
=========

Things you'll need to do:

0. Ensure you have python3.4 installed on your machine.
1. `make`
2. Run `code/MyPyTutor.py` in Python 3.
3. Set your MyPyTutor tutorial folder to `CSSE1001Tutorials` in this repo (this folder will be created when you run `make`).
  * You can do this from "Preferences"/"Configure Tutorial Folder" in the menu.
  * If you already have a MPT installation on your machine, you can also edit `~/mypytutor.cfg`.
