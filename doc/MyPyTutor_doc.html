<h1>MyPyTutor Documentation</h1>
MyPyTutor is a Python tutorial system. There are three components to the system.
The first is the interface used by a 'student' doing the tutorial problems. The 
second is a collection of interfaces used by problem and tutorial developers.
The third is an administrator interface for running MyPyTutor as part of a course.

<h2>The Student Interface</h2>
In this interface the user chooses a problem to work on from the 'Tutorials' menu -
this contains section sub-menus which in turn contain individual problems.
<p></p>
When the user chooses a given problem, the problem description is rendered as HTML
in one window and the user can enter solution code into the code editor window.
This window is essentially the IDLE code edit window. Code that is saved in
MyPyTutor can then be loaded (e.g. via the 'Recent Files' menu) into IDLE and 
visa versa. This makes it easy to move between IDLE and MyPyTutor. It also provides
a familiar interface to the beginner Python programmer. 
<p></p>
At any stage the user can choose 'Check' from the 'Check' menu or simply press F5
and the system will run the problem test code on the user code. Typically,
the system will respond with some output in the output text box below the
problem description.
<p></p>
When the user first starts MyPyTutor it prompts for a folder that contains
the collection of tutorials. This information is stored in a configuration file
along with font information. The user can change this at any time using the 'Options'
menu.
<p></p>
MyPyTutor can be set up to interact with a web server. Registered users can log on, 
submit answers, 
upload/download (partial) answers and view the status of submissions.
<p></p>
MyPyTutor is able to deal with multiple sets of Tutotorial problems. Users are able to configure 
the system for multiple sets and to change from one set to another.
<h2>The Developers Interfaces</h2>
Developers have three interfaces:
<ol>
	<li><kbd>create_problem.py</kbd> - for creating/editing individual tutorial problems</li>
	<li><kbd>test_problem.py</kbd> - for testing tutorial problems</li>
	<li><kbd>create_tutorial.py</kbd> - for creating a tutorial by collecting together problems</li>
</ol>
Typically, developers would create individual problems and add them to the 
problem database, testing as they go. Once a suitable collection of problems have
been created, developers would then create tutorials - a collection of problems.
<p></p>
Two kinds of files are used by MyPyTutor: problem files (with a <tt>.tut</tt> extension)
and tutorial files (with a <tt>.txt</tt> extension). The next two sections describe the contents of these files.

<h2>Problem Files</h2>  
Below is an example of the contents of a problem file.
<P></p>
<pre>
#{Text}#
&#60;h3&#62;Variable Assignment&#60;/h3&#62;
Assignments are used to store information away for later use.
For example, the statement
&#60;br&#62;
&#60;tt&#62;total = 10&#60;/tt&#62;
&#60;br&#62;
assigns the variable &#60;tt&#62;total&#60;/tt&#62; to the value &#60;tt&#62;10&#60;/tt&#62;.
&#60;p&#62;
Later we can use the value stored in the variable in an expression.
For example,
&#60;br&#62;
&#60;tt&#62;average = total/5&#60;/tt&#62;
&#60;br&#62;
assigns &#60;tt&#62;average&#60;/tt&#62; to &#60;tt&#62;2&#60;/tt&#62; (i.e. &#60;tt&#62;10/5&#60;/tt&#62;).
&#60;p&#62;
Assume the variables &#60;tt&#62;item1&#60;/tt&#62; and &#60;tt&#62;item2&#60;/tt&#62; have integers 
associated with them.
Write an assignment statement the assigns the variable &#60;tt&#62;prod&#60;/tt&#62; to the
product of the values stored in variables &#60;tt&#62;item1&#60;/tt&#62; and &#60;tt&#62;item2&#60;/tt&#62;.

#{Hint}#
The right hand of the assignment should be an expression involving &#60;tt&#62;item1&#60;/tt&#62; and &#60;tt&#62;item2&#60;/tt&#62;.
#{Hint}#
The left hand side of the assignment should be &#60;tt&#62;prod&#60;/tt&#62;.

#{TestCode}#
#{global}#
import random
#{test}#
#{start}#
item1_init = random.randint(2,100)
item2_init = random.randint(2,100)
#{init}#
item1 = item1_init
item2 = item2_init

#{code}#
import sys

if prod == item1_init*item2_init:
   print "Correct"
else:
   print_error("Wrong - You got "+str(prod)+ \
               " the correct result is "+str(item1_init*item2_init)+ \
               "\nThe right hand of the assignment should be an expression involving item1 and item2")  
</pre>
<p></p>
Each problem file is divided into blocks - each with a header. The headers are of the form
<tt>'#{'</tt> followed by the header text, followed by <tt>'}#\n'</tt>.
<p></p>
When the applications parse these files, dictionaries are created where each key
is the header text and the corresponding value is the following block of text or
a list (depending on the header type).
<p></p>
We now consider the different block types.

<h3>The Text Block</h3>
This block contains the HTML source for the problem description. The HTML source can
make use of the following tags.
<pre>
h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 
b it tt
br p ul li
pre
img
span
</pre>
The <tt>img</tt> tag is of the form <tt>img src="filename.gif"</tt> - i.e. the image
must be a GIF file.
Currently, only <tt>span</tt> with a colour style of red, green or blue is supported.


<h3>Hint Blocks</h3>
There can be any number of hint blocks - the blocks are collected into a list.
Hint blocks can use any of the above HTML tags.
<h3>Test Code Block</h3>
This top-level block contains several kinds of sub-blocks. The test code block 
should be the last top-level block in the problem text. The application that
creates and edits problems automatically deals with this block header. When the problem is saved
the test code header is automatically added before the test code. When a problem is
loaded, the application splits the text at the test code block and displays
the two halves in separate windows.
<p></p>
The sub-blocks of the test code block are now discussed.
<h4>The Preload Block</h4>
This contains Python code that is automatically loaded into the code edit window.
This could be used, for example, to provide some partially filled in code that
needs to be completed by the user. There is at most one preload block.
<h4>The Global Block</h4>
This is part of the test code. This code is executed once before any of the tests
are executed. This is typically used to make some definitions that will be used
by one or more tests. For example, a class definition for a visitor to be used to 
walk the abstract syntax tree of the user code could be defined here.
There is at most one global block.
<h4>The Timeout Block</h4>
This block (with no body) is of the form <tt>#{timeout = secs}#</tt> and, if supplied,
defines the maximum total time for all the tests. The tests will timeout after
this time if the tests have not completed. The default timeout is one second.
<h4>Test Blocks</h4>
The test block header may also be of the form <tt>#{test repeats = n}#</tt> and
in which case the test will be repeated <tt>n</tt> times.
<br>
Each test has its own block, containing sub-blocks. The sub-blocks are as follows.
<ul>
<li>The Start Block: this is code executed before the user code in an environment
that is not visible to the user code. In the example given earlier, two variables are
initialized for later use by the test code. There is at most one start block.</li>
<li>The Init Block: this code is executed before the user code in the same
environment that will be used when executing the user code. In the earlier example
the values in the two variables from the start block are transferred to other
variables than can be referenced from the user code. 
There is at most one init block.</li>

<li>The Code Block: this code is executed after the user code in an environment
that combines the environments from the global and start code and from the init 
and user code. It is expected that there will be exactly one code block for a given test.
</li>

</ul>
<h4>Special Test Variables</h4>
There are six special variables that can be accessed from the test code. 

<ul>
<li><tt>user_text</tt>: this variable contains the code entered by the user. 
This can be used, for example, to construct the abstract syntax tree of the 
user code for analysis.</li>
<li><tt>print_error</tt>: this function, which takes a string as an argument, is
a simple wrapper for printing to stderr. This is typically used to produce
error messages from failed tests. This function also sets a flag that causes
further testing to be halted.</li>
<li><tt>print_exception</tt>: this function, which takes an exception object e, and 
prints str(e) together with a suggested google query for the error to stderr. This function also sets a flag that causes
further testing to be halted.</li>
<li><tt>print_warning</tt>: this is the same as <tt>print_error</tt> except that
testing continues.</li>
<li><tt>correct</tt>: this function, which take no arguments, displays the string "Correct"
in the output window and sets a flag to say that the users code is correct.</li>
<li><tt>master</tt>: a reference to the application itself so that problems about
GUIs can be written that allow users to create and display a widget as part of the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The create_problem Interface</h2>
The create_problem interface is an editor for creating/editing problems and
looks somewhat like MyPyTutor. The Problem Editor
is where you add the HTML description of the problem, hints and other non-code blocks.
The problem code editor is where the test code block go.
<p></p>
The 'Check' menu tests the problem to make sure the HTML is correct and that the test 
code is valid Python syntax. If the problem passes the test then the problem is 
pretty-printed to 
the output window for human checking.

<h2>The test_problem Interface</h2>
This interface is used to test a problem. Once a problem has been chosen, the 
interface looks and behaves like MyPyTutor. The 'File' menu provides two
mechanisms for reloading the current problem. The first leaves the user code, the
second clears it.
<p></p>
Having both the create_problem and test_problems interfaces open at the same time
is a reasonably efficient way of editing problems. If the test interface finds an 
error in either the problem description or the test code then the problem can be modified.
Then a Ctrl-S in the problem creator, followed by a Ctrl-R in the testing interface
will allow the tests to be continued without having to re-enter the 'answer code'. 

<h2>The create_tutorial Interface</h2>
This interface allows the developer to collect tutorial problems together
to form a tutorial. This is done by creating a tutorial file. Below is
an example of a tutorial file. This example sets MyPyTutor up for web access.

If the first string in square brackets starts with "URL:" (as above) then the remainder 
of that string is assumed 
to point at the MyPyTutor CGI script that provides the web access. If this is present
then the Online menu is added to MyPyTutor and this URL is used to interact with the web
server.
If web access it enabled then the section names must start with a due date followed by a space.
This date will be used by the server to determine if the user submission of a problem 
from that 
section is on time. The date format should match the date format given in the CGI script.
<p></p>  
Tutorial problems are grouped into sections whose names appear in the square brackets.
The individual problems appear as a title followed by a colon followed by the
name of the file containing the problem. This may be optionally followed by more colon
separated strings. These will be treated as names of files that need to be copied
into the tutorial folder. These are files that are referenced in the problem - e.g.
GIF files imbedded in the problem description. These files do not appear in the
generated <tt>tutorials.txt</tt> file.
<p></p>
In the application, a tutorial file can be created or edited. The syntax of
the file can then be checked using the 'Generate Tutorial' menu. Following the check
the tutorial can be built by choosing 'Generate' from the 'Generate Tutorial' menu.
You are required to enter the name of a folder in which to put the tutorial.
This must be a new folder.
<p></p>
When a tutorial is generated the following takes place.
<ol>
	<li>The system copies the tutorial file into the chosen folder and 
renames it <tt>tutorials.txt</tt>. If present, the URL information is removed.</li>
	<li>Each of the specified tutorial files are also 
copied into the folder, a unique ID is created that is added to the testing
code part as an ID tag
and the testing code encrypted.</li>
	<li>The file <tt>config.txt</tt> is added to the chosen folder. 
	It contains a timestamp for when the tutorial was created (used for automatic 
	updating when a user logs in to a web enabled version) and the URL of the server encrypted.</li>
	<li>The contents of the folder is then zipped to produce a zip file with the same 
	name as the folder.</li>
	<li>The file <tt>tut_admin.txt</tt> is created in the folder from which the generate 
	tool is run. It is similar to <tt>tutorials.txt</tt> in that it has the same 
	section headings but the section contents consists of problems for that section with 
	each problem name preceeded with
	that problems ID. This information is used by the CGI script to determine if the 
	student submission has the correct ID and is on time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Web Server</h2>
The main part of the web server is the CGI script <tt>mpt_cgi.py</tt>.
When MyPyTutor is web enabled, MyPyTutor interacts with this CGI script in order
to update/access user information. At the start of the CGI script there is a configuration
section that can be configured by the administrator. It consits of the following information.
<ol>
	<li><tt>data_dir</tt> - this folder contains all the files for the users. 
	The file <tt>users</tt>
	contains the username, password, user type, username and email address.
	Each user has three files that contain the current login key, the code the 
	user has uploaded, 
	and the submission information</li>
	<li><tt>timestamp_file</tt> - this is <tt>config.txt</tt> as described above.</li>
	<li><tt>mpt_version_file</tt> - this contains the version number of current 
	MyPyTutor (e.g. 1.3).</li>
	<li><tt>tut_info_file</tt> - this is the <tt>tut_admin.txt</tt> as described above.</li>
	<li><tt>tut_zipfile_url</tt> - the URL of the tutorial zip file.</li>
	<li><tt>mpt25_url</tt> - the URL of the zip file containing the version of MyPyTutor built for 
	Python2.5</li>
	<li><tt>mpt26_url</tt> - the URL of the zip file containing the version of MyPyTutor built for 
	Python2.6</li>
	<li><tt>date_format</tt> - the date format used for the due dates of problems.</li>
	<li><tt>due_hour</tt> - the time of day (in hours) when the problems are due.</li>
</ol>
Of course, the various files need to be stored in the places specified above.
<p></p>
The files <tt>timestamp_file</tt> and <tt>mpt_version_file</tt> are used 
for automatic updates. When a user downloads and installs a tutorial set, it comes with
its own <tt>config.txt</tt>. Whenever a user logs on to the server, it sends the server
the timestamp of the users version of the tutorials. If that timestamp is older than 
the servers version of the timestamp then the clients tutorial files are automatically updated.
If you don't want this behaviour then you should not change the servers timestamp when the tutorials change.
This, however, can lead to inconsistencies between users who installed the old tutorial and those who install the latest
version.
<p></p>
A similar thing happens with the version number of MyPyTutor. If the version number
of the users version of MyPyTutor is older than that of the server then MyPyTutor
will be automatically updated on login.
<h2>Administration</h2>
The GUI <tt>mpt_admin.py</tt> provides an administrator interface to the online information.
The administrator needs to be registered with MyPyTutor and be of type <tt>admin</tt>.
To do this the administrator needs to manually edit the users file containing all
the user information. To add the password information do the following.
<pre>
python
>>> import crypt
crypt.crypt('yourpassword', 'ab')
</pre>
This should print out the resulted encrypted password. Use this as the password in the users file.
Your initial user file should look something like that given below.
<pre>
# comments are ignored in this file
my_username,my_password,admin,my_first_name_and_initials,my_surname,my_email_address
</pre>
When <tt>mpt_admin.py</tt> is started, a login dialog appears. After you have logged
in you can carry out various administration tasks.

<h3>Add User</h3>
This interface allows you to add a user. When you press the Submit button, the user is
registered with the server. It will then be ready to register another user. Press Cancel
or Quit to exit this interface.
<h3>Add Users From File</h3>
This interface allows users to be added (in bulk) from information supplied in the file.
All users will be registered with the chosen type. 
The format of the file is as a CSV file with line of the form
<pre>
student_number,, ,family_name,given_name_and_initials, username@email, other_info</pre>
</body>
Each user is registered and sent an email with their MyPyTutor user name and password
and some information about MyPyTutor.
<h3>Change User Password</h3>
This interface changes the password for a given user.
<h3>Unset Late Flag</h3>
For various reasons you might like to unset the late flag on some problems for a given user so that
those problems count towards the final score. Enter the required user name and press RETURN.
This will display the submission information for the given user. Now click on the collection of
problems (set as LATE) that you wish to unset and then press Update. The system should
refresh (after a short time) changing the selected LATE entries to OK.
<h3>Match Pattern</h3>
This interface provides a simple search for information in the users file. Enter a string
in the text entry box (e.g. a Family Name) and press RETURN. All matching entries will be displayed.

<h3>Results</h3>
This interface allows you to extract results. The Submit Info button displays the submissions
for each problem as a number and percentage. 
<p></p>
The Check Info button displays the number
of submissions and the average number of times the Check button was used before the
Submit button was pressed in that session. The aim of this is to give an extremely
rough guide to the degree of difficulty of each problem.
<p></p>
The Submit Results button displays the results for each student as a percentage.
